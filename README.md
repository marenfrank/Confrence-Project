### About this folder

Put the files that you would upload to a webserver in this folder. InDesign, Illustrator, Photoshop, Sketch, and Figma files do not belong here, nor do original high-resolution images.

### More on the web1-basic starter project

Original project compiled by [David Ramos](http://imaginaryterrain.com).

The code structure is designed for clarity rather than for browser performance. (Notably, we break CSS out into several files, to help keep code organized.)

This project includes elements from HTML5 Boilerplate (see css/vendor/h5bp_README.md for more).
